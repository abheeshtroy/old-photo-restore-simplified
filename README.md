# old-photo-restore-simplified
This is a reference implementation of paper Bringing Old Photos Back to Life, CVPR2020 (Oral) by Ziyu Wan1, Bo Zhang2, Dongdong Chen3, Pan Zhang4, Dong Chen2, Jing Liao1, Fang Wen2 City University of Hong Kong, Microsoft Research Asia, Microsoft Cloud AI, 4 USTC   Through this colab notebook we have tried to modified the original implementation so that this can be easily used by any person with limited technical knowledge. And this appears like a web page for restoring their personal photos. Click on the play button at the corner of each code block. There are two code blocks. The first one is to download pre trained models, hence it takes some time. This first block needs to be executed only once for a session. The second block has to be played for each image.   This notebook is created by shtadal ghosh and abheesht Roy
